# Building a mult module for a modular synthesizer

## Introduction

In a modular synthesizer, a multiplier lets you "multiply" signals. For example, you could take an LFO signal, and multiply it, so it controls both the pitch of a VCO, and the cutoff of a filter. You could multiply a clock signal, to synchronize the tempo of multiple sequencers.

## Design

Wire the tip terminals together, and the ground terminals together.

## The build

First, I prototyped the module on a piece of cardboard (please ignore my messy living room):

Next, I considered where to install the mult.

Then, we drilled holes.

Then, we brushed the steel. It gave it a nice, sleek look:
