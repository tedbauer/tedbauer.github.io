# Building a mult module for a modular synthesizer

## Introduction

In a modular synthesizer, a multiplier lets you "multiply" signals. For example, you could take an LFO signal, and multiply it, so it controls both the pitch of a VCO, and the cutoff of a filter. You could multiply a clock signal, to synchronize the tempo of multiple sequencers.

## Design

The design consists of wiring together jacks.

## The build

First, I prototyped the module on a piece of cardboard:
